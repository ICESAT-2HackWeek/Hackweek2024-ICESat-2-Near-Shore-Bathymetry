# NASA's ICESat-2 Based Near-Shore Bathymetry

## Objective
We would like to combine time-series of ICESat-2 observations to create a near continuous (depending on the number and quality of the available ICESat-2 passes) near-shore bathymetry map. The next step would be to understand the impact of the Baltic sea storm surge, that occured on October 20, 2023, on the seafloor erosion & deposition.

## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

List the specific project goals or research questions you want to answer. Think about what outcomes or deliverables you'd like to create (e.g. a series of tutorial notebooks demonstrating how to work with a dataset, results of an anaysis to answer a science question, an example of applying a new analysis method, or a new python package).

* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* ...

### Tasks

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (team members will use the scikit-learn python library)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3

## Project Results

Use this section to briefly summarize your project results. This could take the form of describing the progress your team made to answering a research question, developing a tool or tutorial, interesting things found in exploring a new dataset, lessons learned for applying a new method, personal accomplishments of each team member, or anything else the team wants to share.

You could include figures or images here, links to notebooks or code elsewhere in the repository (such as in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder), and information on how others can run your notebooks or code.
