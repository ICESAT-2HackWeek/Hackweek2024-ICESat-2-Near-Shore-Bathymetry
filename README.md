# NASA's ICESat-2 Based Near-Shore Bathymetry

## Objective
We would like to combine time-series of ICESat-2 observations to create a near continuous (depending on the number and quality of the available ICESat-2 passes) near-shore bathymetry map. The next step would be to understand the impact of the Baltic sea storm surge, that occured on October 20, 2023, on the seafloor erosion & deposition.   

Here is more on the 2023 storm:
