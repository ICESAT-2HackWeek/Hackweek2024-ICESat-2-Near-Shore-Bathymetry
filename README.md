# NASA's ICESat-2 Based Near-Shore Bathymetry

## Objective
We would like to combine time-series of ICESat-2 observations to create a near continuous (depending on the number and quality of the available ICESat-2 passes) near-shore bathymetry map. The next step would be to understand the impact of the Baltic sea storm surge, that occured on October 20, 2023, on the seafloor erosion & deposition.   

Here is more on the 2023 storm:

#### What Is SlideRule?<br />https://slideruleearth.io/<br />
SlideRule is a public web service with REST APIs for processing science data and returning results. It provides researchers and other data systems with low-latency access to generated data products using processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. SlideRule runs in AWS us-west-2 and has access to ICESat-2, GEDI, Landsat, and a growing list of other datasets stored in S3. While its web services can be accessed by any http client (e.g. curl), Python and Node.js clients are provided to make it easier to interact with SlideRule.
