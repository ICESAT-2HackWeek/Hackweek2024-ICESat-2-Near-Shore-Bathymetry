## Round 1: Personal Acknowledgement

### Share with us what you learned, were able to do, or how you stretched yourself:

- Lena: Learned the specifics about ICESat-2 data and how to retrieve and access it and data manipulation. If needed could come back to ICESat-2 and use it again.

- Aidana: Was able to understand how to use ICESat-2 to identify lakes and see lake surface and lake bottoms. Was able to modify searches and to get the proper data needed for projects to produce products.

- Hannah: Learned different tools in sliderule, learned there are many ways to do things and how to make code more efficeint. How to search ICESat-2 data and knwos what to try.

- Saeed: Got more familiar with ICESat-2 data and determine if the data is good enough for his own research. Learned some limitations related to the use of ICESat-2 ATL03 product in turbid water.

- Ethan: Learned a lot about how to use ICESat-2 products and all the different measurements.

- Arnab: Observed group and saw how the team was working and how to lead a research team. How team can develop their own solutions.

- Team: Everyone learned a bit about ICESat-2 products, a lot of us learned how to use it.


## Round 2: Team Member Appreciation


### What's something you appreciate about/someone/the team?

### What did they do, offer, say, or quality that made a differnece to you?

- One person couldn't have figured out the problem but the whole team was able to create a product.

- JP was very honest about his knowledge and where he did not understand things.

- Everyone was very open about knowledge gaps.

- Everybody wanted to learn from each other, there was a lot of humility in the group.

- Very collaborative effort across the group, there was no lead author.


## Round 3: Explore Next Steps

### Where do we go from here?
### What are the options for continuing?
### What would that look like?
### Who's in?

- Not all team members will continue using it for personal projects, but they quickly learned whether this data is relevant and applicable to their research.

- Team members learned tools to apply in different aspects of research, taking away new skills.

- The team learned aspects of ICESat-2 that can be turned into tools for other more broad projects.

- The team will try the new ATL24 product and likely explore it further during the next hackweek.

- Due to time constraints, the team couldn't accomplish as much as desired.
